# MY PORTFOLIO WEBSITE

My name is Russell Chew and i am currently a student studying at ngee ann polytechnic.In my Portfolio it includes works that i have done in the past years.

## Design Process
The design was mostly based around me as my favourite colour is teal i try to give a modern/simple vibe to my website.By adding the black and whites it makes the website look cleaner with all the works in the portfolio.

I started out with the home page and i wanted to let my viewers know where am i currently studying or working and also a sneak peak of some of my latest works to keep them interested.

After making them feel interested they would want to know more about me and with this i wanted to show what i have achieved so far my skillset and my educational timeline to show how have arrived to where i am today.

As for the gallery page i tried to make my works look as if they were paintings so is like a gallery show.By making my works with short name to it allows to viewers to know at least abit about the work.

Finally there is the contact Page where i included the map to show where they can find me and also included a contact form so incase they interested in my work or interested in hiring me they can send me a message through this form.
